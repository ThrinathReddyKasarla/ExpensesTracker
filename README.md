This a project on desktop application Expenses Tracker created by python and its libraries.
This code sample is a Python script that creates a desktop application for tracking expenses using PyQt5 for the graphical user interface, SQLite for data storage, and Matplotlib for visualizing expense distribution. Here's a brief overview of its functionalities:

User Interface Setup:
The script defines a main window using PyQt5, containing input fields for date, description, amount, a category dropdown, a table widget for displaying expenses, and a Matplotlib chart for visualization.
Database Connection and Table Creation:
It establishes a connection to an SQLite database file named "expenses.db" and creates a table named "expenses" with columns for ID, date, description, amount, and category.
Data Loading:
Upon application startup, the script retrieves data from the "expenses" table and populates the table widget with existing expenses.
Chart Update:
It queries the database to get the sum of expenses grouped by category and updates a Matplotlib bar chart accordingly.
Expense Addition:
Users can input new expenses through the date, description, amount, and category fields. Clicking the "Add Expense" button inserts a new record into the database.
Expense Editing:
Double-clicking on a cell in the expense table allows the user to edit the corresponding expense value.
Application Exit Handling:
The script ensures the SQLite database connection is closed properly when the application is closed.
In summary, the code provides a basic expenses tracking application with features for adding, editing, and visualizing expenses by category. The graphical interface is built using PyQt5, and the data is stored in an SQLite database. Matplotlib is used to generate a bar chart for visualizing expense distribution.
